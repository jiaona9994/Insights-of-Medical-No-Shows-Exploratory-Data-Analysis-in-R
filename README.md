It is indispensable that hospitals are able to effectively utilize the doctorsâ€™ working hours and maximize the capacity of the hospital resources. However, Patients not showing up for their appointments has become one of the most serious problems in the healthcare sector, which has cost a huge amount of the economic loss every year. Since the no-show patients have a very large effect on the overall efficacy of the healthcare sector, it is important to for us to understand the reasons of the no-show status and find ways to decrease the frequency of the no shows. To be more specific, the reason why I work on this project is to identify patients at a higher risk of not showing up for appointments, and target these individuals for intervention in advance.
